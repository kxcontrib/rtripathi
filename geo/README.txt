 What is this?
===============

An overdue project from college days

=====================
 But, what is this?
=====================

1. It takes as an input geographical coordinates of all zip codes available (zips.txt in data.zip)
2. Maps their location to UTM
3. (For now) provides a function called neighbors which you can call thus:
   
                neighbors[10001;10]
   
   which returns everything near zip code 10001 within a radius of 10*400 and same zone.
   Currently it only works properly for mainland USA, maybe we can expand it for other places

=============
 Why do it?
=============

To demonstrate that it can be done!

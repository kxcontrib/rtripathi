This script demonstrates how to use Simon's k4unit to test multiple
versions of q using scripts present in the subversion repository.

Obvious improvements include testing memory usage and cost.

To run,

1. Modify config.nix to point to the correct location of q binaries

2. Load qtest.q and run:
    
        show start[]
